# LightHouse Game: Rocket Cookie Devil
2D space shooter game from Intro to Programming class at [LightHouse](http://lighthouseholyoke.org/), a self-directed learning center for teens based in Holyoke, MA. All code is written collaboratively by me and the students.

## Installing and Running

The game uses Python 3 (available as the `python3` command in recent versions of macOS; on Windows and Linux, you might need to install it).
```
pip install pygame
python rocket.py  # "python3 rocket.py" on macOS
```
