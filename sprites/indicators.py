    #   - First, we divide the minimum boost over the maximum boost, to find out
    #     how far along the bar we should draw the line (as a ratio). For example,
    #     if MIN_BOOST is 20 and MAX_BOOST is 100, then the ratio would be 0.2.
    #   - Next, we multiply this ratio by the width of the bar to get the actual
    #     number of pixels.
    #   - Finally, we add the x position of the bar to push the whole thing to the
    #     right so it lines up with the bar.
    linex = ((MIN_BOOST / MAX_BOOST) * BOOST_BAR_WIDTH) + barx

    # Line y position is the same as bar

    # Line is 2 pixels wide
    linewidth = 2

    # Line is same height as bar
    lineheight = barheight
